Magento checkout is implemented using the UI components. 
Out of the box, the checkout consists of two steps:
 
 - Shipping Information
 - Review and Payment Information


You can customize the default checkout in many ways. Here the following customizations are described:

 - [Add a new checkout step]({{site.gdeurl}}howdoi/checkout/checkout_new_step.html)
 - [Customize the view of an existing step]({{site.gdeurl}}howdoi/checkout/checkout_new_step.html)

For the sake of compatibility, upgradability, and easy maintenance, do not edit the default Magento code, add your customizations in a custom module.
