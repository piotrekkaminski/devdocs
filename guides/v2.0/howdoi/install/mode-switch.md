The Magento application has three *modes* of operation that make it convenient for you to deploy it in a development or production environment.

The two modes you hear the most about are <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}config-guide/bootstrap/magento-modes.html#mode-introduction">*developer mode*</a> and <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}config-guide/bootstrap/magento-modes.html#mode-introduction">*production mode*</a>. Aptly named, these modes are intended for development and production use, respectively.

Not only do these modes enable you to change Magento application behavior, switching between them using the <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-mode.html">`magento deploy:mode:set`</a> command also sets file system permissions automatically.

To switch modes:

1.	Log in as, or switch to, the <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/prereq/apache-user.html">Magento file system owner</a>.
2.	Change to the `<your Magento install dir>/bin` directory.
2.	Use the `magento deploy:mode:set` command as summarized in the following table.
