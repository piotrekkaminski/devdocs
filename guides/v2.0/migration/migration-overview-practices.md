<h2 id="migrate-overview-benchmarking">Best practices and benchmarking</h2>
This section provides our best information about how to speed up and simplify your migration, and provides guidance about how much time you can expect migration to require.

<h3>Best practices and recommendations</h3>

* Migrate data from a replicated Magento 1 database instance
* Remove outdated and redundant data from your Magento 1 database (for example, you could remove logs, order quotes, recently viewed or compared products, visitors, event-specific categories, promotional rules, and so on)
* To avoid any unexpected issues or conflicts please follow steps described in <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}migration/migration-migrate.html">General Rules for Successful Migration</a>
* To boost performance you can set `<direct_document_copy>1</direct_document_copy>` option in your `config.xml`. In this case, Magento 1 and Magento 2 databases should be located in one MySQL instance, and the database account must access each database


<h3>Benchmarking estimates</h3>

We tested migration on the following system:

* Environment: Virtual Box VM, CentOS 6, 2.5Gb RAM, CPU 1 core 2.6GHz
* Database had 177k products, 355k orders, 214k customers

<h3>Performance Results</h3>

* Settings migration time: ~10 mins
* Data migration time: ~9 hrs (all data except URL Rewrites, ~85% of total data)
* Site downtime estimate: A few minutes to reindex and change DNS settings. Additional time required to “warm up” the page cache
