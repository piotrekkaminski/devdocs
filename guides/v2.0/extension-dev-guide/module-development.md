Magento 2 is flexible and as a result has varied functionality, so developing a component in Magento takes into account a number of different of the following topics. Please read the information on compatibility &#8212; [Service Contracts](service-contracts/service-contracts.html), [Design Patterns](service-contracts/design-patterns.html), and the information on [Dependency Injection](depend-inj.html), [Routing](routing.html), and [Working With Public Interfaces and APIs](api-concepts.html) closely; they are essential to creating a good Magento 2 component.
