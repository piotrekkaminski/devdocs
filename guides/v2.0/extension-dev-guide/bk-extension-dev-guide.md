This guide contains information for developers who want to extend, or customize, any of the components in the Magento application. That includes building a new component from to extend Magento functionality. This guide is also for those who want to create components for Magento Marketplace, although it does not cover the publishing process.

##Magento components

Magento is made up of the following types of components:

* Modules
* Themes
* Language packages

A Magento *module* is code that accomplishes a particular business function or handles a Magento feature. A module is a collection `.php` and `.xml` files, but may also contain other files such as `.phtml` and image files. Modules are interactive with each other. A module also contains any user interface required for a user's interaction with the module, and any application interfaces that another module or code chunk might call, if you decide to expose any application interface to other Magento modules.

*Themes* change the look and feel of the Magento storefront or Admin. 

*Language packages* provide translations for strings that display on the storefront and Admin.

This guide focuses on Magento modules.
