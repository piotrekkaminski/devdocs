The Architecture Guide provides a relatively high-level introduction and view of the Magento product. 

The Magento platform and components are explained from the perspective of several audiences: merchants, web store developers (frontend developers), extension developers, system admins, installers, and integrators.

More detailed information about building online stores, using the Magento APIs, installing, configuring, and extending the platform is included in other books in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}index.html">Magento library</a>.
