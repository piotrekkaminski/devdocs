<h2 id="compman-overview">Overview of System Upgrade</h2>
This section discusses how to start System Upgrade, which upgrades the version of Magento core components as well as any other installed components.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
	<p><em>System upgrade</em> refers to updating the Magento 2.x core components and other installed components. To migrate from Magento 1.x to Magento 2, see the <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}migration/bk-migration-guide.html">Migration Guide</a>.</p>
