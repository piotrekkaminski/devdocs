<h2>Technical Bulletin</h2>

<h5>Date: January 22, 2016</h5><h3>Issue:</h3> 
*2.0.x upgrades fail when installed with .zip archive and then updated either with composer-update or System Upgrade tool.* IF you installed 2.0.0 using a .zip archive, AND you attempt to upgrade to 2.0.1 using either the Magento System Upgrade Utility or Composer, the upgrade process fails. The upgrade fails because certain required files were missing from the .zip file. Note that upgrade processes for installations that did not originally use a .zip file are not affected by this issue.<h3>Resolution:</h3>
*In Progress*Magento is working to deliver a resolution. In the meantime, please refer to the Magento forum for the latest information.*	If you have not yet installed 2.0.1 nor updated to 2.0.1, please wait until a resolution is available shortly. 
*	If you have already attempted to upgrade to 2.0.1 and the process failed, instructions for resolving the failed upgrade will be communicated as soon as possible.
