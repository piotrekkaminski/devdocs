To get your authentication keys:

1.	If you haven't done so already, create an account on <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect">Magento Connect</a>.

	(It's the same as an account on `magento.com`.)

	*	Click **My Account** in the upper right corner of the page.
	*	In the New Customer section, click **Register**.

		If you already have an account, make sure you know your user name and password, then continue with the next step.
2.	At the top of the page, click **Connect**.
3.	In the **Developers** section, click **Secure Keys**.

4.	You have the following options in the right pane:

	*	If you already have keys, use the **Public key** as your user name and the **Private key** as your password.
	*	New key: In the **Name** field, enter a name to identify the keys and click **Generate new**.

		You can optionally generate additional keys; for example, to provide access to `repo.magento.com` to co-workers, contractors, or integrators. 
	*	Regenerate or rename existing keys: Click **Regenerate**. 

		You can regenerate your keys for security reasons; for example, you believe they have been compromised.
	*	Save an existing key if you changed its name: Click **Save**.
	*	Disable keys: Click **Disable**. You can do this if you want to suspend use of your keys.
	*	Delete keys: Click **Delete**.

5.	Come back to this page anytime to view or change your keys.
